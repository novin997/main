By: `Team SE-EDU`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]




The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`, `GroupPersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Group>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::group[]
=== Group feature
==== Current Implementation

The group mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`
and implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#createGroup()` -- Creates a group in the student management system.
* `AddressBook#hasGroup()` -- Checks to see if the student management system has a particular group.
* `AddressBook#hasPersonInGroup()` -- Checks to see if a particular person is in a group.
* `AddressBook#addGroup()` -- Add's persons to a group.
* `AddressBook#removeGroup()` -- Removes a group form the student management system.
* `AddressBook#removeGroupPerson()` -- Removes a student from group form the student management system.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#createGroup()`, `Model#hasGroup()`,
`Model#hasPersonInGroup()`, `Model#addGroup()`, `Model#deleteGroup()` and `Model#deleteGroupPerson()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User inputs `creategroup n/CS1231 l/LT15` to create a group in the student management system.
The `AddressBookParser` detects `creategroup` as a command word to use `CreateGroupCommandParser` to parse the input given.
`CreateGroupCommandParser` will then create a `Group` object containing all of the group's given information after parsing and pass it to `GroupCommand` which will then
execute adding the group created to the student management system.
  +
[NOTE]
If a duplicate groups are found in the student management system during its execution,
it will not create a group nor will it override the existing group but instead, it will throw a `DuplicateGroupException`
which will then notify the user of the issue.

The following sequence diagram shows how the create group operation works within both `Model` and `Logic` components where `g` is the `Group` object created:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Component for the `creategroup n/CS1231 l/LT15` Command +
image::CreateGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


Step 2. The user inputs `addgroup g/1 p/1` to add the first person in the student management system to the first group
in the student management system. The `AddressBookParser` detects `addgroup` as a command word will use `AddGroupCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `AddGroupCommandParser` will then create an `AddGroup` object containing all relevant group and person indexes after parsing and pass it to `AddGroupCommand`
which will then execute adding persons to the specified group in the student management system.
 +
[NOTE]
If a duplicate persons are found in the group of the student management system during its execution,
it will not create a group nor will it override the existing group but instead, it will throw a `DuplicatePersonException` which will notify the user of the issue.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add persons to group operation works within both `Model` and `Logic` components where `ag` is the `AddGroup` object created:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Component for the `addgroup g/1 p/1` Command +
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


Step 3. The user inputs `deletegroupstudent g/1 p/1` to remove the person at the first index (`GroupPersonListPanel`) from the group at the first index (`GroupListPanel`)
in the student management system. The `AddressBookParser` detects `deletegroupstudent` as a command word will use `DeleteGroupPersonCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `DeleteGroupPersonCommandParser` will then create two `Index` objects after parsing and pass it to `DeleteGroupPersonCommand`
which will then execute deleting the person from the specified group from the student management system.
 +

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete group person operation works within both `Model` and `Logic` components:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Component for the `deletegroupstudent g/1 p/1` Command +
image::DeleteGroupPersonSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


Step 4. The user inputs `deletegroup 1` to delete the first group in the student management system. The `AddressBookParser` detects `deletegroup` as a command word and will use `DeleteGroupCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `DeleteGroupCommandParser` will then create an `Index` object after parsing and pass it to `DeleteGroupCommand`
which will then execute deleting the specified group from the student management system.
 +

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete group operation works within both `Model` and `Logic` components:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Component's for the `deletegroup 1` Command +
image::DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Additional Operations:

* `SelectGroupCommand` -- Selects a group on the student management system's GUI which will in turn display all
students in that group on the `GroupPersonList` panel. +

Step 1. The user inputs `selectgroup 1` to select the first group listed on the student management system's GUI. The `AddressBookParser` detects `selectgroup` as a command word and will use `SelectGroupCommandParser`
        to parse the input given. `SelectGroupCommandParser` will then create an `Index` object after parsing and pass it to `SelectGroupCommand`
        which will then execute selecting the specified group on the student management system by posting a new `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent` object coupled with the Index created to the `EventsCenter`.
         +

The following sequence diagram shows how the select group operation works within both `EventsCenter` and `Logic` components:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and EventsCenter Component's for the `selectgroup 1` Command +
image::SelectGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores groups in `addressbook.xml`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Share same database as persons, not modular in terms of future expansions.
* **Alternative 2:** Stores groups in a different file `addressbookgroups.xml`.
** Pros: Modular as groups are stored in a different file, makes data extraction easier.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

// end::group[]

// tag::ScriptCommand[]
=== ScriptCommand feature
==== Current Implementation
The `ScriptCommand` Feature allows the user to run `scripts` that execute the same command multiples time by importing
all Command arguments from a specific text file.

Before the `ScriptCommand` can be executed, there are some prerequisites:

* There must be a default folder for which all the scripts need to be stored
* The default location of scripts folder is `root program location` + `/scripts/`
* All scripts must be of `Text File Format/txt`

==== ScriptSetup feature
If the scripts folder is missing whenever the program run, the program will automatically generate the folder through
the `ScriptSetup` Class

.Sequence Diagram for the `ScriptSetup` Function
image::ScriptSetupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* Procedure for ScriptSetup

Step 1: ScriptSetup will be executed by `MainApp` when the program is initialized and the `ScriptSetup` will be
execute with the parameter containing the default `scripts` folder location.

[NOTE]
 The default scripts folder location is
 obtained from the `preferences.json` file in the main directory

Step 2: `ScriptSetup` will obtain the path of the default script folder by calling `getPath` from the `FileUtil`

Step 3: The `createFolder` function will be called to create a new folder if the `path` does not exist.
A boolean `isScriptFolderPresent` will be return true if the script folder is present in the project folder and false
if it is not present inside the project folder

Step 4: If `isScriptFolderPresent` is false, `scriptSetup` will call `addSampleTextFile` which will add some Sample
Text Files into the scripts folder

Future Implementation:
****
* Provide feedback and logging to users on which command has failed to executed
* Allow the program to change the scripts default location
****
// end::ScriptCommand[]

// tag::distribute[]
=== Distribute All Students feature
==== Current Implementation
The Distribute feature assist the user in distributing all students in the address book to specific number of groups randomly.
The user is able to control if the distribution process should take into consideration of balanced gender or balanced nationality.

In the current version, the following operations have been implemented:

* `DistributeCommand` -- Execute the command to start the Distribution process.
* `DistributeAlgorithm` -- Handles the different types of algorithm depending on the user input flags.
* `DistributeUtils` -- Contains the methods that work closely with DistributeAlgorithm class.

This feature also work with `CreateGroupCommand` and `AddGroupCommand` as Distribute functionality consist of creating groups and adding person into groups.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Distribute mechanism behave at each step.

Step 1: User inputs `distinto 3 n/CS2113-T13- g/0 nat/0` to distribute all students in the student management system randomly into 3 groups. By setting '0' to 'g/' and 'nat/',
user does not want to take gender and nationality into account. The AddressBookParser detects `distinto` or `di` as a command word and proceed to call `DistributeCommandParser`.
The `DistributeCommandParser` will take in the rest of the input and parse the necessary information out. The information that were parsed out are `INDEX`, `GROUP_NAME`, `GENDER_FLAG` and `NATIONALITY FLAG`.
`DistributeCommandParser` will now create a `DistributeCommand` object containing all the Distribute's information extracted after parsing.
`DistributeCommand` receives the inputs and execute the Distribution Command.

[NOTE]
====
- If the `INDEX` value entered by the user is *less than* the number of student in the management system or `INDEX` is *0* or is blank, the command will be rejected and it will
throw a `CommandException` which will notify the user of the issue.
- If the `GROUP_NAME` string entered by the user does not adhere to only contain alphanumeric characters, '-', '[' and ']', and should not be blank, the command will be rejected and it will
throw a `CommandException` which will notify the user of the issue.
- The `GENDER_FLAG` and `NATIONALITY_FLAG` only accepts `1`, `0`, `true` and `false` else the command will be rejected and will throw a `CommandException` which will notify the user of the issue.
====

Step 2: The `DistributeCommand` creates a new `DistributeAlgorithm` Object with an input parameter of a `Distribute` Object which contains the extracted information in Step 1 and a `model` object..
The `DistributeAlgorithm` constructor will proceed to run and check for non null inputs. Once it is completed, it will set `DistributeUtils` to have the same model as the input model.
Next, the method will gather a list of all person in the management system and check if the desired number of groups to be create is lesser than the number of people in the management system.
Once the checks are complete, the `DistributeAlgorithm` method will shuffle all person in it list check the gender and nationality flags. Different combination of flags input results in different distribution algorithm to be run.

Step 3: In every algorithm, the allocation process is different. However, the *Distribution process* is the same throughout all algorithm.

The following sequence diagram shows how the distribution process works within `Logic`, `Commons` components:

==== FlowDiagram Diagrams

==== UML Diagrams

==== Algorithm Implementation
The Distribute Students Equally feature holds 4 different algorithms.
Each Algorithm serve different purposes.

* Distribute Students Randomly with equal numbers
* Distribute Students Randomly with Balanced Gender
* Distribute Students Randomly with Balanced Nationality
* Distribute Students Randomly with Balanced Gender & Nationality (Coming in v1.4)

Every Algorithm will require inputs such as:
****
* int _n_ : Number of Groups to be created of Integer Data Type
* ArrayList<ArrayList<Person>> groupArrayList : 2D ArrayList of Person Type
* LinkList<Person> allPerson : LinkList containing all person data from the current address book
* String groupName : Group Name in String Type
****

From these 4 inputs, every algorithm will run necessary checks, create the required number of groups with the `Group Name` parsed in and add the Students assigned to the group.

[NOTE]
Before any Algorithm execute, the system will check if there exist any duplicate group name.
If such an event occur, the command will stop and throw a `CommandException : Duplicate Groups Found` which will notify the user of the issue.

==== Pre Execution Checks and Operations
Before any Algorithm is execute, there are some checks and functions to be performed.

. Check if _n_ number of groups to be created must be *less than* number of persons in the address book.
.. throw `Command Exception` if _n_ groups is more than > number of persons in address book.
. Check if there exist a group with the *same group name* as the ones to be created.
.. throw `Command Exception` if there exist another group with the intended name to be created.
. Shuffle the Address Book with a time seed.
.. A Better Distribution
. Place All Persons into an LinkList.

==== Algorithm Design Input Parameters

. int _n_
.. Number of Groups to be created
. ArrayList<ArrayList<Person>> groupArrayList
.. A 2D Array List where the *Outer Array List* acts as a group while the *Inner Array List* stores the *Person Object*.
. LinkList<Person> allPerson
.. A LinkList containing all person data from the current address book. Meant for distribution into the 2D ArrayList.
. String groupName
.. The group name required to create the groups.

===== Aspect: Distribute Students Equally Algorithm Explanation

To ensure a balanced number of persons in each group, we have to calculate the minimum number of people to place in a group.
This process of recalculation has to be executed as we access the next group. This allows the distribution to be balanced.

*Allocation Process*

. Creates a For Loop of _n_ number of times. Starting with i equals to _n_ and count down to 0.
. Creates an ArrayList of Person Object.
.. This ArrayList acts as the inner array list to hold all Persons.
. Calculates the number of Person should be in a group.
.. This can be done by having the *total number of Person* in the LinkList divided by *i* from the for loop.
.. Lets label this as _paxInAGroup_
. Creates a While Loop with the condition of _paxInAGroup_ more than 0.
.. In the while loop, we will load a person object from the LinkList into the ArrayList.
. Once the while loop is complete, the array list will be filled with _paxInAGroup_ Persons.
. Now, we add this ArrayList with _paxInAGroup_ of Persons into the 2D ArrayList where the outer acts as a group.
. This process is repeated until the total number of group required to be allocated is complete.

*Distribution Process*

. The `distributeProcess` method will access the 2D ArrayList.
. In each ArrayList of the 2D ArrayList, the distributeProcess Method will access the outer ArrayList and creates a group.
.. The group is created with the given Group Name that the user specified in the Command.
. Next, it will access the inner ArrayList and add all the person allocated inside into the group.
. This process is repeated until the 2D ArrayList is fully accessed.

We will now be able to achieve _n_ groups with all students distributed randomly into them. +

===== Aspect: Distribute Students Equally with Balanced Gender Explanation

The process is quite different from the Algorithm used above. The key difference is that we had separate all female person into a list
and all male persons into another list. After separation, we start the allocation of 1 male person to each group and process repeats until there are no males left.
At that same pointer where the male list turns empty, we will start the allocation of 1 female person to each group. This process continues until all female persons are allocated.

*Allocation Process*

. Creates a For Loop of _n_ number of times. Starting with i equals to _n_ and counts down to 0.
. Creates 2 LinkedList of Person Object.
.. 1 LinkedList to store all male persons
.. 1 LinkedList to store all female persons
. Iterate through allPersonLinkList, store male persons into maleLinkList and store female persons into femaleLinkList.
. Creates a while loops to check if maleLinkList or femaleLinkList is not empty
.. Create a pointer to point to the group number.
.. Creates another while loop to allow the group pointer to iterate infinitely.
... if the group pointer points to the last group, it will reset its pointer back to the first group.
. In the inner While Loop from 4b.
.. Creates an ArrayList of Person Object.
.. Allocate 1 male person from the male LinkList into the inner ArrayList.
... This process is done in the selectiveDistributionByGender method.
.. Add the inner ArrayList into the outer ArrayList of the 2D ArrayList.
.. Move the group pointer to the next group and repeat from Step 5
. Once maleLinkList is exhausted, repeat Step 5 with the female LinkList.

*Distribution Process*

. The `distributeProcess` method will access the 2D ArrayList.
. In each ArrayList of the 2D ArrayList, the distributeProcess Method will access the outer ArrayList and creates a group.
.. The group is created with the given Group Name that the user specified in the Command.
. Next, it will access the inner ArrayList and add all the person allocated inside into the group.
. This process is repeated until the 2D ArrayList is fully accessed.

We will now be able to achieve _n_ groups with all students distributed randomly with balanced gender. +

===== Aspect: Distribute Students Equally with Balanced Nationality Explanation

The process is quite similar to the Algorithm used above. The key difference is that we had to collect the total number of different nationalities in the Person list.
We can achieve this by using a Map to filter out the different nationalities as the key and the number of persons belonging to that nationality as the values.
We have to also sort the map by the values decreasingly to ensure the highest pax of a single nationality is distributed first.
Once we have the Map of different nationalities and the number of values in each nationality, we can follow the previous algorithm and allocate 1 person from the same nationality to 1 group at a time.
After exhausting all person from the same nationality, we can repeat the same process for the next nationality. This ensure all groups to have a balanced and mixed nationality.

*Allocation Process*

. Initialize a group pointer.
. Creates a for loop that iterates based on the Map's number of key which is the number of different nationality.
. Creates another for loop that iterates based on the key's values which is the number of person that has the same nationality.
.. Creates an ArrayList of Person Object.
.. In each iteration, we locate a person with the specific Nationality (key) and add into inner ArrayList.
... This process is done by the selectiveDistributionByNationality method.
.. Next, we will add the inner ArrayList into the outer ArrayList of the 2D ArrayList.
.. A group pointer will be moved to the next group and the process is repeated from Step 3b.
. Once the value in the particular nationality is exhausted, the for loop in Step 2 will point to the next Nationality.
. The process now repeats from Step 3 until the For Loop in Step 2 is exhausted.

*Distribution Process*

. The `distributeProcess` method will access the 2D ArrayList.
. In each ArrayList of the 2D ArrayList, the distributeProcess Method will access the outer ArrayList and creates a group.
.. The group is created with the given Group Name that the user specified in the Command.
. Next, it will access the inner ArrayList and add all the person allocated inside into the group.
. This process is repeated until the 2D ArrayList is fully accessed.

We will now be able to achieve _n_ groups with all students distributed randomly with balanced nationality. +

Coming in v1.4

// end::distribute[]

// tag::grademanagement[]
=== Grade_management feature
==== Current Implementation
The grade management feature is to help university lecturer to manage students grade. It includes to add Test (test name test marks) and edit test marks for each student, grade summary
command to show summary of each test(highest/lowest/median/mean score of this test, show a list of students who has fallen into top/last twenty five percent of this test), assign grade command
to assign grade to all students who has taken certain test and delete test command to allow user to delete a certain test record from all students.
Since every student will have many different tests during the semester. Our grade management feature will allow user to add and store multiple tests for each students. A table of
student's test grade will be displayed in the browser panel of each student. The user can have a overview of each student's different tests and grade by click the student's card at the left most.

In the current version, the following operations have been implemented:

* `AddTestMarksCommand` -- Execute the command to add test into a student.(each student can store many different tests)
* `EditTestMarksCommand` --  Execute the command to edit test mark of a student.
* `GradeSummaryCommand` -- show grade summary of each test.
* `AssignGradeCommand` -- assign grade base on bell curve calculation of each test(the grading is base on the test name input, only grading the students who has taken that test).
* `deleteTestMarksCommand` -- delete certain test from all students(who has this test name in their test list).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the grade management mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User inputs `adt studentname tn/CS1231 tm/66` to add test into a student in the student management system.
The `AddressBookParser` detects `adt` as a command word to use `AddTestMarksCommandParser` to parse the input given.
`AddTestMarksCommandParser` will then pass studentname, testname,testmarks to `AddTestMarksCommand` which will then
execute adding the test to the student.
  +
[NOTE]
If a duplicate tests are found in the student management system during its execution, it will not add the test , it will throw a `DuplicateTestException`
If a duplicate name keywords are found in the student management system during its execution,
it will not add the test , it will throw a `DuplicatePersonException` to ask user to indicate the full name
which will then notify the user of the issue.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add test operation works within both `Model` and `Logic` components:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Component for the `adt studentname tn/CS1231 tm/66` Command +
image::AddTestMarks.png[width="800"]


Step 2. User inputs `edt studentname tn/CS1231 tm/77` to edit test marks of a student in the student management system.
        The `AddressBookParser` detects `edt` as a command word to use `EditTestMarksCommandParser` to parse the input given.
        `EditTestMarksCommandParser` will then pass studentname, testname,testmarks to `editTestMarksCommand` which will then
        execute editing the test of the student.
 +
[NOTE]
If a duplicate tests are found in the student management system during its execution, it will not add the test , it will throw a `DuplicateTestException`
If a duplicate name keywords are found in the student management system during its execution,
it will not add the test , it will throw a `DuplicatePersonException` to ask user to indicate the full name
which will then notify the user of the issue.

The sequence diagram is similar to the adt command above, just the command name changed.

Step 3. The user inputs `disp tn/ highest/` or `disp tn/ lowest/` or `disp tn/ median/` or `disp tn/ mean/` or `disp tn/ TTF/` or `disp tn/ LTF/` to show grade summary of certain test.
The `AddressBookParser` detects `disp` as a command word will use `GradeSummaryCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `GradeSummaryCommandParser` will pass test name to `GradeSummaryCommand`
which will then execute display the grade summary.
 +

The following sequence diagram shows how the grade summary command works within both `logic` and `UI` components:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and UI Component for the `disp tn/ highest/` or `disp tn/ lowest/` or `disp tn/ median/` or `disp tn/ mean/` or `disp tn/ TTF/` or `disp tn/ LTF/` Command +
image::GradeSummary.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The user inputs `agpt` grading students who has taken certain test. The `AddressBookParser` detects `agpt` as a command word and will use `AssignGradeCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `AssignGradeCommandParser` will then  pass test name to `AssignGradeCommand`
which will then execute grading students of certain test in the student management system.
The sequence diagram is similar to the adt command above.
 +

Step 5. The user inputs `dt` to delete certain test in the student management system. The `AddressBookParser` detects `dt` as a command word and will use `DeleteTestMarksCommandParser`
to parse the input given. `DeleteTestMarksCommandParser` will then  pass test name to `DeleteTestMarksCommand`
which will then execute deleting the test from the student management system.
The sequence diagram is similar to the adt command above.
 +

The sequence diagram will be similar to addTestMarksComand.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Input
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** input is name but not indix.
** Pros: Easy for user to use. If user has many students in the system and when user want to
add test marks its very inconvenient if user use index cause you have to find the index of each student
before you add test. use name as input save a lot of time for user.
** Cons: hard to implement.

===== Aspect: Storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores test in Person as a list.
** Pros: Easy to link test to each person,cause it is part of person.
** Cons: need to add test in every part relate to person,hard to implement.

// end::grademanagement[]


// tag::sendemail[]
=== Send Email feature
==== Current Implementation
The send email feature is facilitated by `JavaMail` API. It provides a platform-independent and protocol-independent framework to build mail and messaging applications.

In the current version, the following operations have been implemented:

* `EmailCommand` -- The command to send an email to single and multiple indexes of persons, or to persons belonging to a group.
* `EmailUtil` -- The helper function that interacts with `JavaMail` for sending email.
* `EmailLoginCommand` -- The command to enter credentials for the email account to be used for sending emails.

The feature currently supports the following mail servers:

1. `Google Mail` -- @gmail.com

2. `Microsoft Outlook` -- @outlook.com

3. `Hotmail` -- @hotmail.com

4. `Live` -- @live.com

5. `NUS Student` -- @u.nus.edu

6. `NUS Staff` -- @nus.edu.sg

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the EmailCommand behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in the command to send email.

* Single Person Index

image::EmailCommandSingleIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Single Person Index w/ Command Alias

image::AliasEmailCommandSingleIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Multiple Persons Index

image::EmailCommandMultipleIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Multiple Persons Index w/ Command Alias

image::AliasEmailCommandMultipleIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Group Index

image::EmailCommandGroupIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Group Index w/ Command Alias

image::AliasEmailCommandGroupIndexDiagram.png[width="500"]


[NOTE]
If a login credential is not found in the system, the following message will be shown.

image::EmailCommandNoLoginFound.png[width="500"]

In order for an email to be sent, there must be a sender account.

[NOTE]
If subject title exceeds 78 characters, the following message will be shown.

image::EmailCommandExceedSubjectLength.png[width="700"]

Although it is possible for subject field to contain more than 78 characters, the system
sets a limit to prevent subject title folding.

==== Sequence Diagrams

image::EmailCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1200"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to send email to a single person
Initially, the idea was to identify the recipient by their full name, but after awhile, we found
that using the pre-existing `Index` class to be a better way to select our recipient.

To send an email to a single person, we simply identify the `Index` of the person we want to send
to from any list (full listing or filtered list) and enter it into the sendmail command.


===== Aspect: How to send email to multiple person
Since we are able to send email to a single person using their index, we can identify more recipients
using their associated `Index` in the listing.

To send an email to multiple persons, we simply identify all their `Index` and enter them into the
sendmail command separated by a comma. We then add a parser to identify that this is an email command
for multiple persons and add them all into the recipient list.

===== Aspect: How to send email to a group of persons

Similar idea for sending email to single or multiple person(s). Instead of identifying `Index` of persons,
now we simply identify an entire list of person using their `Group` `Index`, add a parser to identify that
it is an email command for sending to a group and then add all of the persons into the recipient list.

===== Aspect: How to allow email login from different mail servers

To support more mail servers (initially only Google mail was supported through hardcoding), we maintain a list
of mail servers under `Domain`. To add a new mail server support, we need primarily three information:

* The SMTP Hostname

image::EmailCommandDomainHost.png[width="400"]

* The SMTP Port (465 or 587)

image::EmailCommandDomainPort.png[width="300"]

* Is it TLS or SSL (if SSL, we need to add trust into `Properties`)

image::EmailCommandDomainTrust.png[width="450"]

When the user enter their email credentials using `login` command, we will be able to identify which mail
server their email uses by looking at the domain (@example.com). We then set `Properties` with the relevant
domain information.



===== Aspect: How to send email with attachments

To send emails with attachment, we consider allowing the user to specify a path to the attachment or we can
 fix a specific folder where the attachments has to be in to be included in the email.

We then make use of MimeMessage provided by `JavaMail` API and create a Multipart message.
// end::sendmail[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
