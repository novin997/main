== PROJECT: Student Management System

---

== Overview

Student Management System is a desktop system used primarily by university lecturers, interacting with it via CLI commands on a GUI created by JavaFX.
Lecturers are able to manually `add` their students to the management system and also to `groups created` within the system.
The system also allows for automated processes such as `scripts` to execute any command, removing the need for manual entry when facing large amounts od data.
Other notable features include sending of `emails`, adding `tests marks`, assigning `grades` and `automatic group distribution` based on gender or nationality.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=rajdeepsh[Code]]
* *Main Feature*: *Groups*
** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to create groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to create a groups in the student management system and displays the groups created on a separate panel.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to have a list of all his modules/tutorial groups.
*** Highlights: This feature required an in-depth analysis of storage alternatives as storing group data in a separate xml file would be more modular but difficult to implement, given our time constraints.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to select groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to select groups in the student management system via a CLI command and displays the students in the group selected on a separate panel.
*** Justification: This feature was implemented to allow for some flexibility when it comes to inputs as some lecturers may prefer typing over clicking.
*** Highlights: This feature was to be paired later on with a find group feature, but due to time constraints find group was not implemented.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to add students to groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to add students to existing groups in the student management system.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to have a list of students in a particular module/tutorial group.
*** Highlights: This feature was to be further improved by synchronizing it with the edit command - e.g. if a person is edited in the
student management system, that person would also be edited in all the groups he/she is in by simply removing the old person and adding the updated person. However,
 due to time constraints, it was not further improved.

** *Functionality*: Added *the ability to delete groups*
*** What it does: Allows the lecturer to remove groups from the student management system.
*** Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the lecturer to organize/edit the management system.

student management system, that person would also be deleted in all the groups he/she is in. However,
 due to time constraints, it was not further improved.
