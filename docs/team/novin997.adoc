== PROJECT: Student Management System

---

== Overview

*Student Management System (SMS)* is a desktop application which uses CLI for its interactions. SMS allows university lectures
to easily organise and manage their students and classes by allowing the lectures to easily import student lists given by their department.
*SMS also provides* neat features such as distributing students into groups, sending emails to them and assigning test grades, SMS makes being a university lecturer more convenient!

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to execute scripts from Text File*
** What it does: The Text File will contain multiple lines of the commands parameter that the lecturer would like to execute
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because now the lecturer do not need to manually add students into the Student Management System.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: FileUtils (Apache Commons IO 2.5 API)

* *Minor enhancement*:
** The `scripts` folder location can be set in the Preferences.json. If the `scripts` folder in the Preferences.json is not valid, the default scripts location will be used.
** Upon initializing the program if the scripts folder is missing, the folder will be automatically generated.
** If the `Script Command` run the Text File with either the wrong command selected or invalid parameters, a log file will be automatically generated to indicate which line, the command has failed to execute
