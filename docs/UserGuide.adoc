== Introduction

*Student Management System (SMS)* is a desktop application which uses CLI for its interactions.
SMS allows university lectures to easily organise and manage their students and classes by allowing the lectures to easily import student lists given by their department.
SMS also provides neat features such as distributing students into groups, sending emails to them and assigning test grades,
SMS makes being a university lecturer more convenient! +
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Student.Management.System.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SMS.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` :
adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Student Management System.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Please kindly refer to <<ScriptSetup Function>> to understand on how to setup the `Student Management System` to use the `scripts` function properly

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
